# academics-csp
Using CSP solver to build an academic plan, given constraints such as :
* Maximum difficulty per semseter
* Minimum amount of courses per semester
* Course dependency
* Courses being unavailable in some semesters
* All courses must be learned
* A course can not be learned twice
* Must study every semester
* Must finish before a given semseter

`constraint.py` is a Python 3.6 which I converted to Python 3.9
`main.py` is the CSP usage

Cheers! 🍺
